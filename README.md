Abstract:<br>
The life-threatening disease caused by the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has garnered
global attention and has become a pandemic, leading to a high number of cases and fatalities.
Saliva droplets or nasal discharge from coughing and sneezing of an infected individual are the
primary means of COVID-19 transmission. While many daily activities carry a relatively lower
risk, there are certain high-risk activities for virus transmission. This study aims to identify
these activities, categorizing them into main and sub-activities. Hierarchical analysis was used
to rank these activities based on their risk and potential for virus spread. Results indicate
varying levels of risk—low, moderately low, moderate, moderately high, or high—determined
by calculated weights. It is crucial to adhere to guidelines provided by the WHO, the CDC, and
local authorities. This article presents a list of daily activities and their associated risk rankings
to help individuals understand and mitigate risks, urging them to take necessary precautions.
